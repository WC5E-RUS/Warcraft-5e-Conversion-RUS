# Chapter 1: Monstrous Adventurers
Heroes come in many shapes and size, some of which are ancient on the face of Azeroth, and others have just recently emerged to offer their assistance. This chapter presents character races that many would consider to be monstrous or directly hostile towards members of either faction. 

If you're the DM, including these races in your campaign is a storytelling opportunity, a chance for you to decide the roles that different peoples play in the tales you weave. 

If you're a player, consult with your DM before using any of the races here. Your DM may say yes or no to you using a race or subrace, or may modify it in some way.

### Racial Traits
The game traits of the monstrous races are unusual in that some of these races have a reduction to an ability score, and some are more or less powerful than the typical races of Azeroth, additional reasons for monstrous races to be used in a campaign with care.

The following races are detailed in this chapter:
<div style='margin-top:-5px;'></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Furbolg.** are forest guardians who prefer peaceful meth-ods to protect their homes but take up arms if they must.

**Gnoll.** are a simple-minded but vicious race of humanoid hyenas, they are a deeply pack driving race who love to let others do the hard work for them.

**Harpy.** are vicious flying creatures who nest in hard to keep places and kill any intruder to their lands.

**Kobold.** are a diminutive race who dwell in and around caverns and mines. They are not intelligent by mosts races standards and notorious for being cowardice.

**Mok'nathal.** are half-breeds born between an orc and ogre, outcasts that are rarely found welcome among either.

**Murloc.** are amphibious beings that dwell along coasts and lakeshores, they are deeply territorial and few wanders too close to their tribal camps.

**Naga.** are ocean-dwelling hybrids that follow the rule of their queen, Azshara, for dominion over Azeroth.

**Quilboar.** are aggressive boar-like humanoids living in isolated labyrinths of thorns and rock faces.

**Satyr.** are vicious bestial demons created by an ancient curse, they are born spellcasters working for a greater evil.

**Tortollan.** are nomadic travelers that wander Azeroth and live to exploring the world around them.

***Bite.*** Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, in-stead of bludgeoning damage normal for a unarmed strike.

***Natural Armor.*** Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell pro&shy;vides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.

***Storyteller.*** You gain proficiency in the History skill.

***Listen for a While.*** You are able to use a spell scroll with a casting time of an action as a bonus action. You can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

***World on my Back.*** Your shell works as a backpack, and can hold up to 40 pounds of gear, you can also strap items to the outside of it. For an item to be tucked behind into your shell, it has to be smaller than 1 cubic foot. Your speed is not reduced by any gear stored within your shell.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and two other languages of your choice. Tortollans does not have a language of their own, but are fond of learning other languages, they are exceptional storytellers and love to hear and tell the stories of other races.
