# Chapter 3: New Backgrounds
### Dark Apothecary
The Royal Apothecary Society (or the Apothecary Society, and abbreviated R.A.S.) is an alchemical society based in the Apothecarium in Undercity. It was created by Lady Sylvanas Windrunner in order to create a new undead plague to wipe out the Scourge. Its members are all Forsaken or other types of undead beings who joined Sylvanas' cause. They are constantly brewing up new plagues and poisons to unleash upon Sylvanas' enemies. The other races of the Horde believe they are working on a remedy to cure their "illness". Members of the Apothecary society are called Apothecaries or Dark Apothecaries.

<br> **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, Investigation.
<br> **Tool Proficiencies:** Alchemist's supplies, poisoner's kit.
<br> **Equipment:** Alchemist's supplies or poisoner's kit, an arm-
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; band with an embroidered flask and crown, a notebook, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a set of black velvet robes, and a pouch containing 15 gp.

#### Feature: R.A.S. Agent
As a member of the Royal Apothecary Society, you have access to a network of supporters and operatives that are working under the official support of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner. Anywhere where you can find Forsaken, you can find the Dark Apothecaries, that can support you with safe houses, assistance in finding information, herbs or alchemical ingredients. This is a two way coin, though, and they might expect you to help them with one or more tasks.

#### Suggested Characteristics
As a member of the Royal Apothecary Society you are probably curious in nature. Whether or not you're looking for a cure or a weapon you are likely to be striving for the better of the Forsaken, albeit not necessary for the Horde. Remember that "better" never means "better for everyone".
Your bond might be associated with other members of the Royal Apothecary Society, or a location or an object that is important to it. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of the Society, but might be more personal in nature.

### Double Agent
You are an informant for an opposing faction or organi&shy;zation, secretly providing them with false information on behalf of another organization in which your loyalty lies. You may be an informant for the Scarlet Crusade, providing them with false intel on behalf of the forsakens. Perhaps you are a member of the Bilgewater Cartel, providing the goblin trade partners with false information to give the cartel the richest scores whilst staying out of their reach.

Discuss with your DM the factions/organizations you are working with and against.

#### Feature: Two Sides of One Coin
You have contacts within both organizations that you provide information to and/or for. Official organizations will often allow you to commit minor crimes without fear of punishment, or run a business without paying all the taxes or fees typically required. Additionally, you can gain an audience with functionaries from both organizations.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Having to work for two sides, hearing each sides story and delivering crucial information false or not. This is not a life for all, often shaping carries to leave personal connections behind, distance themselves from 'close' allies.

|&nbsp; 7       || I hide behind a facade, only showing my true self to trusted friends. |
|&nbsp; 8       || I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let emotions control me. |

|&nbsp;&nbsp;d6 |&nbsp;&nbsp;| Ideal |

|&nbsp; 1       || **Selfless** I use my position to help good people avoid prosecution or victimization. (Good) |

|&nbsp; 5       || I am vindictive and impulsive. |
|&nbsp; 6       || I am reckless and seek dangerous thrills. |

### Faction Fostered
You were abandoned at birth and found by members of the opposing faction, taken in by a family and raised as a member of their faction. Having had a harsh childhood of being shunned upon by members of the faction, never fully being accepted but merely tolerated in their presence.

You might be a tauren born in the eastern kingdoms, and abandoned by your parents, to be found by human farmers that took you in, nurtured you and raised you as their own, or you may be a human of Theramore, who ran away from your home, to be taken in by orcs and raised as a member of the horde within Orgrimmar, taught how to fight and learn the language of orcs.

Discuss with your DM the details of the faction and race who raised you, as not all races of Azeroth have an equal relationship towards other races.

<br> **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Perception
<br> **Languages:** You can speak your choice of Darnassian, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Draenei, Dwarven, or Gnomish.
<br> **Equipment:** A set of common clothes, hooded cloak, a 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trinket of your faction, book, one bottle of ink, one quill, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and a belt pouch containing 10 gp

#### Feature: A False Allegiance
Your race and appearance makes you able to enter and go undisturbed through villages and cities of both factions, eye may wander upon you as you walk, but none will stop and ask questions, or raise arms against you.

#### Suggested Characteristics
Having lived a life amongst races of the opposite faction, getting to know and love their customs often make faction fostered social skills within their born faction limited. They are nonetheless social individuals, many of which greatly appreciate the races they now have grown up with, and stand by their side against their own kin.

|&nbsp;&nbsp;d8 |&nbsp;&nbsp;| Personality Trait |
|:-------------:|:-|:-----------|
|&nbsp; 1       || I am optimistic and appreciate simple gestures given to me. |
|&nbsp; 2       || I am genial and make an honest effort to get along with my new faction.|
|&nbsp; 3       || I smile often, but I am distrustful of people outside my family. |
|&nbsp; 4       || I am quiet and study the people around me intently. |
|&nbsp; 5       || I am always looking over my shoulder. |
|&nbsp; 6       || I am uncomfortable in urban settings and only truly feel safe on the open road. |
|&nbsp; 7       || I am friendly and extremely curious. |
|&nbsp; 8       || I love to talk to people and hear their stories. |

#### Feature: A Prominent Mentor

\columnbreak

#### Suggested Characteristics
