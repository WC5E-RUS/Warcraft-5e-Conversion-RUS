# Chapter 4: New Equipment
The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of many sorts: dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, troll charms, goblin relics, and gnome jewelers, not to mention humans of every shape, size, and color drawn from a spectrum of nations and cultures. In the largest cities, almost any&shy;thing imaginable is offered for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets, practical swords, and beautiful elven bows.

For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount impor&shy;tance, since proper equipment can mean the difference between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face of the threats that Azeroth presents.

## Starting Equipment
When you create your character, you receive equipment based on a combination of your class and your chosen background. Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces based on your class and spend them on items from the lists in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class table to determine how much gold you have to spend.

You decide how your character came by this starting equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods that the character purchased during his or her upbringing. You might have been equipped with a weapon. armor, and a backpack as part of military service. You might even have stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation until your character finally took up the mantle and followed in an ancestor's adventurous footsteps.

## Exotic Weapons
Your race or class may grant proficiency with weapons that are not considered commonly used by all races or classes. Such weapons include the circular moon swords of night elves, the engraved battle totems of taurens, and the iconic warglaive used by demon hunters.

### Exotic Weapon Proficiency
Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain exotic weapons. Exotic weapons are less traditional and require specific training for each weapon, with many of these weapons providing specific benefits in return. While they require a special proficiency to be wielded properly, an exotic weapon function as a martial weapon for the purpose of effects that specific simple or martial weapons.

Proficiency with an exotic weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using an exotic weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

#### New Weapon Properties
New weapon properties are described here.

***Booming.*** The ignition of powder in a firearm creates a loud noise, a flash of light, and a smell of burnt explosives. This weapon can be heard as far as 200 feet away when a ranged attack roll is made with it.

### Exotic Weapons
Exotic weapons are often unique and unlike any simple or martial weapon, each exotic weapon is described here.

***Battle totem.*** Battle totems are intricately carved tree trunks. They serve as items of cultural significance as a piece of art and history and a heavy bludgeoning weapon.

***Moon sword.*** Moon swords are odd circular blades about 2-1/2 feet in diameter with a sharpened edge forming almost the complete circle. These crescent blades are iconic among night elven wardens and are a stable of an extremely skilled warrior.

***Moonglaive.*** Moonglaives are favored among night elven sentinels. The weapon consists of three equidistant curved blades that extend from a central handle.

***Pistol.*** Pistols are short metal cylinders attached to stout handles or iron or wood. Although they appear simple, in&shy;tricate contraptions are hidden beneath its surface.

***Rifle.*** Rifles appear similar to pistols, with their metal barrels extending 1 to 2 feet compared to the 3 inches of a pistol. Much of a rifle's barrel is often hidden by wood.

***Twinblade.*** Twinblades are favored by the blood elven spellbreakers. They consist of two long blades extending from either end of a mid-length handle.

***Warclaw.*** Warclaws are common among orcs, shamans, and certain monks. They consist of several foot-long blades extending from a grip held in the fist, which is covered by a protective gauntlet or glove.

***Warglaive.*** Warglaives are common among night elves and blood elves, and favored by demon hunters. The glaive is made up of two crescent blades that extend in opposite directions from a central hilt.

</div>

#### Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here. To utilize these effects, you must be proficient with the weapon.

***Battle Totem.*** If you can cast spells, you can use this weapon as a spellcasting focus while wielding or carrying it. In addition, the battle totem serves as a portable ram.

***Moon Sword.*** Whenever you successfully grapple a creature or win a contested grapple check while wielding this weapon, you deal damage to the creature as if you'd hit it with a weapon attack.

***Moonglaive.*** When you make a ranged attack with this weapon and miss, the weapon returns to your hand at the end of your turn.

***Twinblade.*** When you make an attack with this weapon as part of the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make an extra melee attack with it. This attack counts as an off-hand attack for the purpose of two-wepaon fighting.

***Warclaw.*** This weapon requires an action to don or doff. While donned, you can't be disarmed of it and your hand is considered empty for the purpose of holding objects or creating somatic components for spells. You can't wield a weapon or hold a shield in the same hand that has a warclaw donned.

## Adventuring Gear
This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation. Certain items have also had their price adjusted to better reflect their status in Azeroth.

***Bayonet.*** This short blade can be attached to the end of a firearm or crossbow as an action, allowing the weapon to be used in a melee attack. A bayonet on a ranged weapon is treated as a spear in terms of proficiency and damage. When wielded alone, a bayonet is treated as a dagger.

\columnbreak

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Beacon.*** A beacon is a tinkers invention that appears <br> to be a larger version of a lantern. It casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. As an action, you turn the light on or off or you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

***Bomb.*** As an action, a character can light this bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 fire damage.

***Buzzbox.*** This small backpack allows the wearer to communicate with other buzzboxes within 5 miles of it. The device is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.

***Dynamite.*** As an action, a creature can light a stick of dynamite and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 thunder damage.

***Firestarter.*** This small container is capable of producing a tiny flame that sheds bright light in 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with exposed fuel—takes an action.

***Flashlight.*** A flashlight casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. As an action, you can turn the flashlight on or off.

***Glowsitck.*** One or more glowsticks can be lit using your action, providing bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet for 8 hours. Once lit, a glow&shy;stick cannot be extinguished.

***Parachute.*** A creature wearing this backpack-shaped piece of gear can deploy it as a reaction while falling. The creature's falling speed is reduced to 60 feet per round until it lands, taking no damage, and the creature becomes one size larger for purposes of space. Once it has been used, the parachute takes 10 minutes to repack.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***Scope.*** A scope can be attached to a two-handed firearm or crossbow using 1 minute. You can use your bonus action to aim through the scope, removing the disadvantage of attacking at long range until the end of your turn.

***Suturing Kit.*** A suturing kit is a small collection of needles and threads of quasi-magical origin. A forsaken can use it to reattach severed body parts or repair damages to its body. They can also use the kit to attach body parts from other corpses to themselves, provided that the body part matches a missing part on their own body. Use of this kit usually requires a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check and takes anywhere from a couple minutes to a few hours, depending on the extent of the procedure.

#### Gunsmith's Tools
Gunsmith's tools enable a character to create firearms and produce ammunition.

***Components.*** Gunsmith's tools include a ball-peen hammer, sets of screwdrivers, pin punches, files and pliers, safety goggles with amplifying lenses, rulers and squares, cleaning rods, grease and oil bottles, a powder horn, a small mortar and pestle, and lastly, screws and springs.

***Crafting Firearms.*** If you are proficient with gunsmith's tools, you can craft a pistol or rifle over the course of one workweek (5 days of 8 hours of work) by spending 50 gp worth of materials and resources.

***Crafting Bullets.*** If you are proficient with gunsmith's tools, as part of a long rest, you can make bullets in batches of 6 + double your proficiency bonus. You need to spend 1 gp in materials per batch you make.
